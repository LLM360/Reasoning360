The slope of $PQ$ can be found using the formula for the slope between two points: $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.

Using this $x$-value in the original function $f(x) = x^2$, we find the corresponding $y$-value: $y = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.

      "judge comment: To solve this problem, let's break it down. Each pack normally contains 1 red pencil, but 3 packs contain 2 extra red pencils each (so 3 red pencils per these packs). The student needs to find the total number of packs based on the total number of red pencils, which is 21. If we denote the number of normal packs as \\(N\\) and the number of packs with extra pencils as \\(3\\), the total number of red pencils can be written as \\(N + 3*3 = 21\\). Simplifying this gives \\(N + 9 = 21\\), so \\(N = 12\\). The total number of packs is \\(N + 3 = 15\\). The reference answer states the total number of packs is 18, which suggests another interpretation might have been used, but based on the direct problem statement and calculation, the student's answer of 15 seems mathematically correct.\n",

      "judge comment: First, let's analyze the question and the reference answer to understand the expected solution. The question states that the baker had 7 boxes for donuts and ended up with 6 extra donuts after splitting them evenly. This means the total number of donuts must be 7 times a certain number plus 6, indicating the number of donuts is 7n + 6, where n is the number of donuts in each box. The reference answer provided is 6, which does not seem correct per the question's logic since this number doesn't account for the donuts being placed into 7 boxes and having 6 left over.\n",

The question asks for how many donuts the baker made, given that he ended up with 6 extra donuts after splitting them evenly among 7 boxes. The reference answer of \"6\" does not seem to match the context of the question well because it is too low to be split among 7 boxes and still have 6 extra. However, if we look at the student's answer of 48, this fits the context better because 48 donuts can be evenly split among 7 boxes with 6 extra (since 48 - 6 = 42, and 42 is divisible by 7).

      "judge comment: To determine the correctness of the student's answer, we need to solve the given problem using the provided information. The problem states that the length (L) of a rectangular field is 10 meters more than its width (W), and the diagonal measures 22 meters. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can create an equation: \\(L^2 + W^2 = 22^2\\). Given that \\(L = W + 10\\), substituting \\(L\\) in the equation gives \\((W + 10)^2 + W^2 = 484\\). Simplifying and solving the quadratic equation leads to \\(W^2 + 10W + 25 + W^2 = 484\\), which simplifies to \\(2W^2 + 10W - 459 = 0\\). Solving this quadratic equation, we get \\(W = \\frac{-10 \\pm \\sqrt{10^2 + 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 459}}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{-10 \\pm \\sqrt{3716}}{4} = \\frac{-10 \\pm 2\\sqrt{929}}{4} = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{929}}{2}\\). Since width cannot be negative, \\(W = \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{929}}{2}\\). Thus, the length \\(L = W + 10 = \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{929}}{2} + 10 = 5 + \\frac{\\sqrt{929}}{2}\\), which simplifies to \\(5 + \\sqrt{232.25}\\), which is approximately \\(5 + \\sqrt{217}\\) due to rounding. The reference answer, 22, does not match the result of solving the equation; therefore, the student's answer is correct in the context of solving the problem, whereas the reference answer seems incorrect or may have been given without solving the problem correctly.\n",
