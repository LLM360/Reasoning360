       "    'content': \"<think>\\nOkay, let me think about this question. What's the minimal number that is divisible by 2, 3, and 5? Hmm, so I need to find the smallest number that can be divided evenly by each of these three numbers: 2, 3, and 5. \\n\\nFirst, I remember that when a number is divisible by multiple numbers, it's called a common multiple. And the smallest one is the least common multiple (LCM). So maybe I need to find the LCM of 2, 3, and 5. \\n\\nHow do I calculate the LCM again? Oh, right. One way is to list the multiples of each number until I find the smallest one that is common to all. But that might take a while if the numbers are large. Is there a more efficient method? \\n\\nYes, there's another method using prime factors. Since 2, 3, and 5 are all prime numbers, actually. So the LCM would be the product of the highest powers of all primes present in the numbers. Wait, but since each number here is a distinct prime, the LCM would just be their product. Let me confirm that. \\n\\nIf I have numbers that are all primes, then their LCM is just the multiplication of all of them, right? Because primes have no common factors other than 1. So, for example, the LCM of 2, 3, and 5 would be 2 * 3 * 5 = 30. Is that correct?\\n\\nLet me verify. Let's see: 30 divided by 2 is 15, which is an integer. 30 divided by 3 is 10, also an integer. 30 divided by 5 is 6, which is an integer as well. So 30 is divisible by 2, 3, and 5. \\n\\nNow, is there any smaller number that's divisible by 2, 3, and 5? Let's think. The multiples of 2 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., 30, etc. The multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, etc. The multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, etc. The smallest number that appears in all three lists is 30. So that seems to check out.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I were to use the prime factorization method, since each number (2, 3, 5) is prime, their LCM is simply the product of the primes, each raised to the power of 1. So 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^1 = 30. So same result.\\n\\nTherefore, the minimal number divisible by 2, 3, and 5 is 30.\\n\\nBut wait, let me just double-check in case I'm missing something. Suppose someone thinks that maybe multiplying two of them would give a smaller number. For example, 2*3=6, but 6 isn't divisible by 5. Similarly, 2*5=10, which isn't divisible by 3. And 3*5=15, not divisible by 2. So all those are missing at least one divisor. So the next step is multiplying all three together. So 2*3*5=30. Then 30 is divisible by each. \\n\\nAlternatively, is there a number less than 30 that is divisible by 2, 3, and 5? Let's think. If a number is divisible by 2, 3, and 5, it has to be a multiple of each. The least such number would be the LCM. Since LCM is 30, there's no smaller number. \\n\\nAnother way: Suppose there exists a number x < 30 that is divisible by 2, 3, and 5. Then x must be divisible by 2, so x is even. It must also be divisible by 3 and 5. So x must be a common multiple of 2, 3, and 5. But we know that the least common multiple is 30, so any common multiple must be a multiple of 30. Therefore, the next one would be 60, then 90, etc. So x cannot be less than 30. Therefore, 30 is the minimal.\\n\\nSo I think the answer is 30. Therefore, the minimal number is 30. \\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe minimal number divisible by 2, 3, and 5 is \\\\boxed{30}.\\n</think>\\nTo find the minimal number divisible by 2, 3, and 5, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers. \\n\\nSince 2, 3, and 5 are all prime numbers, the LCM is the product of these primes. This is because the LCM of prime numbers is simply their product, as they have no common factors other than 1.\\n\\nCalculating the product:\\n\\\\[\\n2 \\\\times 3 \\\\times 5 = 30\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWe verify this by checking if 30 is divisible by each of the numbers:\\n- 30 divided by 2 is 15\\n- 30 divided by 3 is 10\\n- 30 divided by 5 is 6\\n\\nAll results are integers, confirming that 30 is divisible by 2, 3, and 5. \\n\\nWe also check if there is any smaller number divisible by all three. The multiples of each number show that 30 is the smallest common multiple. Additionally, any number less than 30 cannot be a common multiple of 2, 3, and 5 because it would not satisfy the divisibility criteria for all three primes.\\n\\nThus, the minimal number divisible by 2, 3, and 5 is \\\\(\\\\boxed{30}\\\\).\",\n",
